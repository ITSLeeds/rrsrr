# R basics {#basics}

Learning a programming language is similar to learning a human language such as French.
Although you could just dive in and start gesticulating to people in central Paris, it's worth taking time to understand of the structure and key words of the language first.
The same applies to data science: it will help to understand a little about syntax and grammar of the R language before diving into using it for applications such as road safety research.
This chapter may seem tedious for people who just want to crack on and load-in data.
However, working through the examples below is recommended for most people unless you're already an experienced R user, and even experienced R users may learn something about the language's unique syntax in the following sections.

## Creating and removing R objects

R can be understood as a giant calculator.
If you feed the console arithmetic tasks, it will solve them precisely and instantly.
Try typing the following for examples (note that `pi` is an inbuilt object) into the R console in RStudio and pressing `Enter` to make R run the code:

```{r}
2 + 19
pi^(19 + 2) / exp(2 + 19) 
```

Use the same approach to find the square route of 361 (answer not shown):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sqrt(361)
```

This is all well and good, providing a chance to see how R works with numbers and get practice with typing commands into the console.
However, a key benefit of R is that it is *object oriented*, meaning it stores values and complex objects such as data frames representing road casualties and processes them *in memory* (meaning that R is both fast and memory hungry when working with large datasets).

The two most common ways of creating objects are with the the `<-` 'arrow' or `=` 'equals' assignment operators.^[
We use equals assignment for speed of typing and to avoid ambiguity in commands such as `x<-1` vs `x< -1`, although `<-` has historically been (and still is) more commonly used in many fields.
]
Let's reproduce the calculations above but using objects to make the final command more concise:

```{r}
x = 2
y = 19
z = x + y
pi^z / exp(z)
```

The previous code chunk created three objects called `x`, `y` and `z`.
You can call R objects anything you like, provided they do not start with numbers or contain reserved symbols such as `+` and `-`.
You can use various stylistic conventions when naming your R objects, including `camelCase` and `dot.case`
[@baath_state_2012].
We advocate using `snake_case` a style that avoids upper case characters to ease typing and uses the underscore symbol (`_`) to clearly demarcate spaces between words.
Create objects that more closely approximate road casualty data as follows:

```{r}
vehicle_type = c("car", "bus", "tank")
casualty_type = c("pedestrian", "cyclist", "cat")
casualty_age = seq(from = 20, to = 60, by = 20)
```

## Classes and object length

```{r}
crashes = data.frame(vehicle_type, casualty_type, casualty_age)
```



## Subsetting by index or name

Subsetting returns part of an R object. 
It can be done by providing numbers representing the positions of the elements we want (e.g. the 2^nd^ element) or with a logical vector, with values associated with `TRUE` returned. 
Two dimension object such as matrices and data frames can be subset by rows and columns.
Subsetting in base R is done with square brackets `[]` after the name of an object. **Run the following commands to practice subsetting.**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
casualty_age[2:3] # second and third casualty_age
crashes[c(1, 2), ] # first and second row of crashes
crashes$vehicle_type # returns just one column
crashes[, c("casualty_type", "casualty_age")] # first and third columns
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
crashes[, c(1, 3)] # first and third column of crashes by positional numbers
crashes[c(2), c(3)]
crashes[c(2), c(2, 3)]
class(crashes[, c(1, 3)])
class(crashes[c(2), c(3)])
```

1. Use the `$` operator to print the `dark` column of `crashes`.
1. Subset the crashes with the `[,]` syntax so that only the first and third columns of `crashes` are returned.
1. Return the 2^nd^ row and the 3^rd^ column of the `crashes` dataset. 
1. Return the 2^nd^ row and the columns 2:3 of the `crashes` dataset. 
1. **Bonus**: what is the `class()` of the objects created by each of the previous exercises? 

## Subsetting by values

It is also possible to subset objects by the values of their elements.
This works because the `[` operator accepts logical vectors returned by queries such as 'is it less than 3?' (`x < 3` in R) and 'was it light?' (`crashes$dark == FALSE`), as demonstrated below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)] # 1st, 3rd, and 5th element in x
x[x == 5] # only when x == 5 (notice the use of double equals)
x[x < 3] # less than 3
x[x < 3] = 0 # assign specific elements
casualty_age[casualty_age %% 6 == 0] # just the ages that are a multiple of 6
crashes[crashes$dark == FALSE, ]
```

1. Subset the `casualty_age` object using the inequality (`<`) so that only elements less than 50 are returned.
1. Subset the `crashes` data frame so that only tanks are returned using the `==` operator.
1. **Bonus**: assign the age of all tanks to 61.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
casualty_age[casualty_age < 50] # the  casualty_age less than 50
crashes[crashes$vehicle_type == "tank", ] # rows where the name is tank
crashes$casualty_age[crashes$vehicle_type == "tank"] = 61
```

## Dealing with NAs and recoding

R objects can have a value of NA. This is how R represents missing data.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
z = c(4, 5, NA, 7)
```

NA values are common in real-world data but can cause trouble, for example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sum(z) # result is NA
```

Some functions can be told to ignore NA values.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sum(z, na.rm = TRUE) # result is equal to 4 + 5 + 7
```

You can find NAs using the `is.na()` function, and then remove them

```{r, eval=FALSE}
is.na(z)
z_nona = z[!is.na(z)] # note the use of the not operator !
sum(z)
```

If you remove records with NAs be warned: the average of a value excluding NAs may not be representative.

## Changing class

Sometimes you may want to change the class of an object.
This is called class coercion, and can be done with functions such as `as.logical()`, `as.numeric()` and `as.matrix()`.

1. Coerce the `vehicle_type` column of `crashes` to the class `character`.
1. Coerce the `crashes` object into a matrix. What happened to the values?
1. **Bonus:** What is the difference between the output of `summary()` on `character` and `factor` variables?

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
crashes$vehicle_type = as.character(crashes$vehicle_type)
as.matrix(crashes)
```

## Recoding values

Often it is useful to 'recode' values.
In the raw STATS19 files, for example, -1 means NA.
There are many ways to recode values in R, the simplest and most mature of which is the use of factors, as shown below:

```{r}
z = c(1, 2, -1, 1, 3)
l = c(NA, "a", "b", "c") # labels in ascending order
z_factor = factor(z, labels = l)
z_charcter = as.character(z_factor)
z_charcter
```

1. Recode `z` to Slight, Serious and Fatal for 1:3 respectively.
1. Bonus: read the help file at `?dplyr::case_when` and try to recode the values using this function.

## Saving R objects

You can also save individual R objects in the RDS format.

```{r}
saveRDS(crashes, "crashes.Rds")
```

We can also read back in our data.

```{r}
crashes2 = readRDS("crashes.Rds")
identical(crashes, crashes2)
```

R also supports many other formats, including CSV files, which can be created and imported with the functions `readr::read_csv()` and `readr::write_csv()` (see also the [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package).

```{r readr-write, eval=FALSE}
readr::write_csv(crashes, "crashes.csv")
crashes3 = readr::read_csv("crashes.csv")
identical(crashes3, crashes) 
```

Notice that `crashes3` and `crashes` are not identical, what has changed? Hint: read the help page associated with `?readr::write_csv`.

## Now you are ready to use R

**Bonus: reproduce the following plot**

```{r smile, out.width="30%", fig.align="center"}
# eyes = c(2.3, 4, 3.7, 4)
# eyes = matrix(eyes, ncol = 2, byrow = T)
# mouth = c(2, 2, 2.5, 1.3, 3, 1, 3.5, 1.3, 4, 2)
# mouth = matrix(mouth, ncol = 2, byrow = T)
# # pdf("figures/smile.pdf")
# # png("figures/smile.png")
# plot(eyes, type = "p", main = "RRR!", cex = 2, xlim = c(1, 5), ylim = c(0, 5))
# lines(mouth, type = "l", col = "red")
# dev.off()
knitr::include_graphics("figures/smile.png")
```
