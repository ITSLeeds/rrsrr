# R packages {#pkgs}

## What are packages?

R has over 15,000 packages published on the official 'CRAN' site and many more published on code sharing sites such as GitHub.
Packages are effectively plugins for R, that extend it in many ways.
Packages are useful because they enhance the range of things you can do with R, providing additional functions, data and documentation that build on the core (or technically 'base') R packages.
They range from general-purpose packages such as `tidyverse` and `sf` to domain-specific packages such as `stats19`.

This chapter demonstrates the package lifecycle with reference `stats19` and provides a taster of R's visualisation capabilities with reference to the general purpose packages `ggplot2` and `dplyr`.
The `stats19` package is particularly relevant for reproducible road safety research: its purpose is to download and clean road traffic casualty data from the UK's Department for Transport.
Domain-specific packages such as `stats19` are often written by subject-matter experts, providing tried and tested solutions in a particular specialism.

Regardless of which packages you install and use, they all go through the following main stages:^[
If for whatever reason you want to uninstall a package you can uninstall it in a fifth stage with commands such as `remove.packages("stats19")`.
]

1. installing it
2. loading it
3. using it
4. updating it

Of these, the third stage takes by far the most amount of time.
Stages 1, 2 and 4 are equally important, however: you cannot properly use a package unless it has been properly installed, loaded and, to get the best performance out of the latest version, updated when new versions are released.
We will learn each of these stages of the package lifecycle with the `stats19` package.

## The stats19 R package

Like many packages, `stats19` was developed to meet a real world need.
STATS19 data is provided as a free and open resource by the Department for Transport, encouraging evidence-based and accountable road safety research and policy interventions.
However, researchers at the University of Leeds found that repeatedly downloading and formatting open STATS19 data was time-consuming, taking valuable resources away from more valuable (and fun) aspects of the research process.
Importantly, manually recoding the data, from `1` to `Fatal` for example, was error-prone.
By packaging-up code to reliably solve the problem for ourselves, we found that we could solve the problem in a free, open and reproducible way for everyone [@lovelace_stats19_2019].

By abstracting the process to its fundamental steps (download, read, format), the package makes it easy to get the data into appropriate formats (of classes `tbl`, `data.frame` and `sf`), ready for for further processing and analysis steps.
The package built on previous work [@lovelace_who_2016] with several important improvements, including the conversion of crash data into geographic data into `sf` data frame for geographic research [e.g. @austin_use_1997].
A useful feature of the package is that it enables creation of geographic representations of the data, geo-referenced to the correct coordinate reference system, in a single function, called `format_sf()`.
Part funded by the RAC Foundation, the package should be of use to academic researchers and professional road safety data analysts working at local authority and national levels in the UK.

The following sections demonstrate how to install, load and use packages with reference to `stats19`, know-how that can be used to install and use any package.

## Installing packages

The `stats19` package is available on CRAN.
This means that it has a web page on the CRAN website at [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org) --- see [cran.r-project.org/package=stats19](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stats19) --- with useful information including who developed the package, what the latest version is and when it was last updated.
More importantly, being 'on CRAN' (which technically means 'available on the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/)') means that that it can be installed with the command `install.packages()` as follows:^[
To install the development version, which may have new features or but fixes that are not yet on CRAN, you can use the function`remotes::install_github("org/pkg")`.
The `stats19` package is hosted on the rOpenSci organisation at [github.com/ropensci/stats19](https://github.com/ropensci/stats19), so you can install the development version with `remotes::install_github("ropensci/stats19")` (you must have the `remotes` package installed before that will work).
Note: it's usually safest to stick with the latest version on CRAN unless you know what you're doing.
]

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("stats19")
```

You might think that now that the package has been loaded we can start using it, but that is not true, as illustrated below command, which tries and fails to run the `find_file_name()` function from the package (check that this function exists by running the following command `?find_file_name`) to find the file containing STATS19 casualties data for the year 2019:

```{r, error=TRUE}
find_file_name(years = 2019, type = "casualties")
```

## Loading packages

After you have installed a package the next step is to 'load' it.^[
Technically, this means that the *package namespace has been attached to the search path*, making their functions available from the global environment [@wickham_advanced_2014].
]
Load the `stats19` package, that was installed in the previous section, as follows:

```{r}
library(stats19)
```

What happened? 
Other than the message telling us about the package's datasets (most packages load silently so do not worry if nothing happens when you load a package), the command above made the functions and datasets in the package available to us.
Now we can use functions from the package without an error message, as follows:

```{r}
find_file_name(years = 2019, type = "casualties")
```

This raises the question: how do you know which functions are available in a particular package?
You can find out using autocompletion, by pressing `Tab` after typing the package's name followed by two colons.
Try typing `stats19::` and then hitting `Tab`, for example.
You should see a load of function names appearing which you view by pressing `Up` and `Down` on your keyboard.

The final thing to say about packages is that you can use them without loading them by typing `package::function()`.
`stats19::find_file_name(years = 2019, type = "casualties")` works even if the package isn't loaded.
You can test this by running the following command (which reports the versions of key geographic libraries you have installed on your system) in three different ways, the first of which fails but the second of which succeed:

```{r, error=TRUE}
# try running a function without loading the package first
sf_extSoftVersion()
```
```{r}
# run a function from a package's namespace without loading it using ::
sf::sf_extSoftVersion()
```

```{r}
# fun a function call after loading the package (the most common way)
library(sf)
sf_extSoftVersion()
```

As a bonus, try running the command `sf::sf_extSoftVersion` without the brackets `()`.
What does that tell you about the package?

## Using packages

After loading a package, as described in the previous section, you can start using its functions.
In the `stats19` package, that means the following command, which uses the `stats19` function `get_stats19()`, will work:

```{r, message=FALSE}
crashes_2019 = get_stats19(year = 2019, type = "accidents")
nrow(crashes_2019)
```

The command demonstrates the value of packages.
It would have been possible to get the same dataset by manually downloading and cleaning the file from the [STATS19 website on data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data).
However, but using the package the process has happened much faster and with fewer lines of code than would have been possible using general-purpose base R functions.
The result of the `nrow()` function call shows that we have downloaded a decent amount of data representing over 100k road traffic casualty incidents across Great Britain in 2019.

We will use other functions from the package in subsequent chapters.
If you would like learn more about `stats19` and how it can be used for road safety research check out its vignettes.
The `stats19` vignette, for example, should appear in the **Help** panel in the bottom right panel in RStudio after running the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("stats19")
```

## Updating packages

Update packages with the command `update.package()` or in Tools > Check for Package Updates in RStudio.
You only need to install a package once but packages can be updated many times.
To update just one package, you can give the function a package name, e.g.:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
update.packages(oldPkgs = "stats19")
```

Completing the following short exercises will ensure you've got a good understanding of packages and package versions.

1. Take a look in the Packages tab in the Files pane in RStudio (bottom right by default).
1. What version of the `stats19` package is installed on your computer?
1. What happens the second time you run `update.packages()`. Why?

## ggplot2

`ggplot2` is a generic plotting package that is part of the ['tidyverse'](https://www.tidyverse.org/) meta-package,  an "opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science". 
<!-- All packages in the tidyverse "share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures".  -->
`ggplot2` is flexible, popular, and has dozens of add-on packages which build on it, such as `gganimate`.
To plot non-spatial data, it works as follows (the command should generate the image shown in Figure \@ref(fig:crashes2019time)):

```{r crashes2019time, message=FALSE, fig.cap="A simple ggplot2 graph."}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(crashes_2019) + geom_bar(aes(date), width = 1)
```

A key feature of the `ggplot2` package is the initiation function `ggplot2()`, which takes a data object as its main augument, followed by one or more 'geoms' that represent layers (in this case a bar chart represented by the function `geom_bar()`).
Another distinctive feature of `ggplot2()` is the use of `+` operator to add layers.
The package is excellent for generating publication quality figures.
Starting from a basic idea, you can make incremental tweaks to a plot to get the output you want.
Building on the figure above, we could make the bin width wider and add colour depending on the crash severity, for example, as follows:

```{r ggpropcrashes, out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', fig.cap="Demonstation of fill and position arguments in ggplot2."}
ggplot(crashes_2019) + geom_bar(aes(date, fill = accident_severity), width = 1)
ggplot(crashes_2019) +
  geom_bar(aes(date, fill = accident_severity), width = 1, position = "fill") +
  ylab("Proportion of crashes")
```



The package is huge and powerful, with support for a very wide range of plot types and themes, so it is worth taking time to read the documentation associated with the package, starting with the online [reference manual](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) and heading towards the online version of the package's official [book](https://ggplot2-book.org/) [@wickham_ggplot2_2016].
As a final taught bit of `ggplot2` code in this chapter, create a facetted plot showing how the number of crashes per hour varies across the days of the week by typing the following into the Source Editor and running the chunk line-by-line (the meaning of the commands should become clear by the end of the next Chapter):

```{r ggfacetr, fig.cap="A plot showing a facetted time series plot made with ggplot2.", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
crashes_2019 %>% 
  mutate(hour = lubridate::hour(datetime)) %>% 
  mutate(day = lubridate::wday(date)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(hour)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(hour, fill = accident_severity)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1.01) +
  facet_wrap(~day)
```
1. Install a package that build on `ggplot2` that begins with with `gg`. Hint: enter `install.packages(gg)` and hit Tab when your cursor is between the `g` and the `)`.
1. Open a help page in the newly installed package with the `?package_name::function()` syntax.
1. Attach the package.
1. **Bonus:** try using functionality from the new 'gg' package building on the example above to create plots like those shown below (hint: the right plot below uses the economist theme from the `ggthemes` package, try other themes).

```{r gg-extend, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
# install.packages("ggthemes")
g1 = ggplot(crashes_2019) + geom_point(aes(x = casualty_type, y = casualty_age)) 
g2 = ggplot(crashes) + geom_point(aes(x = casualty_type, y = casualty_age)) +
  ggthemes::theme_economist()
g3 = cowplot::plot_grid(g1, g2)
ggsave(filename = "figures/ggtheme-plot.png", width = 8, height = 2, dpi = 80)
```

```{r gg2, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
library(ggplot2)
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ggtheme-plot.png")
```

## dplyr

Another useful package in the tidyverse is `dplyr`, which stands for 'data pliers' and provides a handy syntax for data manipulation.
`dplyr` has many functions for manipulating data frames and using the pipe operator ` %>% `. 
The pipe puts the output of one command into the first argument of the next, as shown below (note the results are the same):

```{r}
library(dplyr)
class(crashes)       
crashes %>% class()
```

We will learn more about this package and its other functions in Chapter \@ref(data).
