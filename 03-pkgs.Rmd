# R Packages

## What are packages?

R has over 15,000 packages (effectively plugins for base R), extending it in almost every direction of statistics and computing.
Packages provide additional functions, data and documentation. They are very often written by subject-matter experts and therefore tend to fit well with the workflow of the analyst in that particular specialism.
There are two main stages to using a package: installing it and loading it.
A third stage is updating it, this is also important.

<!-- installing it... -->
Install new packages from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/) with the command `install.packages()` (or `remotes::install_github()` to install from GitHub).
Update packages with the command `update.package()` or in Tools > Check for Package Updates in RStudio.
You only need to install a package once.
<!-- **Note: avoid `install.packages()` within a script** -->
<!-- Packages only need to be installed once. -->
<!-- You can use `remotes::install_cran()` or `remotes::install_github()` to only install a package if it is not yet installed and up-to-date (note: you only need to use one of these): -->

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
# remotes::install_github("r-spatial/sf")
```

<!-- now talk about loading packages -->
Installed packages are loaded with the command `library()`.
Usually, the package will load silently.
In some cases the package will provide a message, as illustrated below.

```{r}
library(sf)
```

To use a function in a package without first loading the package, use double colons, as shown below (this calls the `tibble()` function from the `tibble` package).

```{r tibble2, eval=FALSE}
crashes_tibble = tibble::tibble(
  vehicle_type,
  casualty_type,
  casualty_age,
  dark
)
```

1. Take a look in the Packages tab in the Files pane in RStudio (bottom right by default).
1. What version of the `stats19` package is installed on your computer?
1. Run the command `update.packages()`. What happens? Why?

## ggplot2

Let's take a look at a particular package.
`ggplot2` is a generic plotting package that is part of the ['tidyverse'](https://www.tidyverse.org/) meta-package, which is an "opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science". 
All packages in the tidyverse "share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures". 
`ggplot2` is flexible, popular, and has dozens of add-on packages which build on it, such as `gganimate`.
To plot non-spatial data, it works as follows (see figure below, left for result):

```{r, message=FALSE, out.width="40%", eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(crashes) + geom_point(aes(x = casualty_type, y = casualty_age))
```

Note that the `+` operator adds layers onto one another.

1. Install a package that build on `ggplot2` that begins with with `gg`. Hint: enter `install.packages(gg)` and hit Tab when your cursor is between the `g` and the `)`.
1. Open a help page in the newly installed package with the `?package_name::function()` syntax.
1. Attach the package.
1. **Bonus:** try using functionality from the new 'gg' package building on the example above to create plots like those shown below (hint: the right plot below uses the economist theme from the `ggthemes` package, try other themes).

```{r gg-extend, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
# install.packages("ggthemes")
g1 = ggplot(crashes) + geom_point(aes(x = casualty_type, y = casualty_age)) 
g2 = ggplot(crashes) + geom_point(aes(x = casualty_type, y = casualty_age)) +
  ggthemes::theme_economist()
g3 = cowplot::plot_grid(g1, g2)
ggsave(filename = "figures/ggtheme-plot.png", width = 8, height = 2, dpi = 80)
```

```{r gg2, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
library(ggplot2)
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ggtheme-plot.png")
```

## dplyr and pipes

Another useful package in the tidyverse is `dplyr`.
It provides functions for manipulating data frames and using the pipe operator ` %>% `. 
The pipe puts the output of one command into the first argument of the next, as shown below (note the results are the same):

```{r}
library(dplyr)
class(crashes)       
crashes %>% class()
```

Useful `dplyr` functions are demonstrated below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
crashes %>%
  filter(casualty_age > 50) # filter rows
crashes %>%
  select(casualty_type) # select just one column
crashes %>%
  group_by(dark) %>% 
  summarise(mean_age = mean(casualty_age))
```

1. Use `dplyr` to filter row in which `casualty_age` is less than 18, and then 28.
1. Use the `arrange` function to sort the `crashes` object in descending order of age (hint: see the `?arrange` help page).
1. Read the help page of `dplyr::mutate()`. What does the function do?
1. Use the mutate function to create a new variable, `birth_year`, in the `crashes` data.frame which is defined as the current year minus their age.
1. **Bonus:** Use the ` %>% ` operator to filter the output from the previous exercise so that only observations with `birth_year` after 1969 are returned.

```{r dplyr, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# answers
crashes %>% 
  arrange(desc(casualty_age))
crashes %>% filter(casualty_age > 21)
crashes %>% 
  mutate(birth_year = 2019 - casualty_age) %>% 
  filter(birth_year > 1969)
```
