# Introduction

This document provides information, code and, vitally, exercises to test and improve your R skills.
It starts with introductory R skills that will be of use in any domain but the focus is on R for Road Safety, in support of a [2 day course](https://www.racfoundation.org/introduction-to-r-for-road-safety).
The course is based on open road crash records from the **stats19** package [@lovelace_stats19_2019].
Code and data supporting the content can be found in the package's GitHub repo at [github.com/ropensci/stats19](https://github.com/ropensci/stats19/).
The '[issue tracker](https://github.com/ropensci/stats19/issues)' associated with that repo is a good place to ask questions about the course. 

## Prerequisites

If you are not experienced with R, it is strongly advised that you read-up on and more importantly **test out** R and RStudio before attempting analyse road crash data with R.
See the `stats19-training-setup` vignette at https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/articles/stats19-training-setup.html for guidance on getting started with R, RStudio and installing R packages.

The completing the course requires that the following packages, which can be installed with `install.packages()`, can be loaded as follows:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(pct)      # access travel data from DfT-funded PCT project 
library(sf)       # spatial vector data classes
library(stats19)  # get stats19 data
library(stplanr)  # transport planning tools
library(tidyverse)# packages for 'data science'
library(tmap)     # interactive maps
```

You should type, run and ensure you understand each line of code in this document.


```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  out.width = "50%"
)
```

```{r pkgs, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
pkgs = c(
  "sf",          # spatial data package
  "stats19",     # downloads and formats open stats19 crash data
  "dplyr",       # a package data manipulation, part of the tidyverse
  "tmap"         # for making maps
)
```

```{r cite, echo=FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(x = pkgs, "packages.bib")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
remotes::install_cran(pkgs)
# remotes::install_github("ITSLeeds/pct")
```

The workshop is based on a practical handout that can be found [here](https://github.com/ropensci/stats19/releases/download/1.1.0/stats-19-exercises.pdf).

# Introduction

This vignette supports workshops on road safety analysis with R.
It was initially developed for a 2 day [Introduction to R for Road Safety](https://www.racfoundation.org/introduction-to-r-for-road-safety) course funded by the [RAC Foundation](https://www.racfoundation.org/), a charity that supports road safety research.

The course is based on open access road crash data from the UK, which is provided in an accessible form to R users through the R package **stats19** [@lovelace_stats19_2019].
However, the content should be of use for anyone working with road crash data that has (at a minimum):

- A timestamp
- A location (or address that can be geocoded)
- Attribute data, such as severity of crash, mode of vehicles involved etc.

You should type, run and ensure you understand each line of code in this document.


# Manipulating R objects

## Subsetting by index or name

Subsetting returns part of an R object. 
It can be done by providing numbers representing the positions of the elements we want (e.g. the 2^nd^ element) or with a logical vector, with values associated with `TRUE` returned. 
Two dimension object such as matrices and data frames can be subset by rows and columns.
Subsetting in base R is done with square brackets `[]` after the name of an object. **Run the following commands to practice subsetting.**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
casualty_age[2:3] # second and third casualty_age
crashes[c(1, 2), ] # first and second row of crashes
crashes$vehicle_type # returns just one column
crashes[, c("casualty_type", "casualty_age")] # first and third columns
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
crashes[, c(1, 3)] # first and third column of crashes by positional numbers
crashes[c(2), c(3)]
crashes[c(2), c(2, 3)]
class(crashes[, c(1, 3)])
class(crashes[c(2), c(3)])
```

1. Use the `$` operator to print the `dark` column of `crashes`.
1. Subset the crashes with the `[,]` syntax so that only the first and third columns of `crashes` are returned.
1. Return the 2^nd^ row and the 3^rd^ column of the `crashes` dataset. 
1. Return the 2^nd^ row and the columns 2:3 of the `crashes` dataset. 
1. **Bonus**: what is the `class()` of the objects created by each of the previous exercises? 

## Subsetting by values

It is also possible to subset objects by the values of their elements.
This works because the `[` operator accepts logical vectors returned by queries such as 'is it less than 3?' (`x < 3` in R) and 'was it light?' (`crashes$dark == FALSE`), as demonstrated below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)] # 1st, 3rd, and 5th element in x
x[x == 5] # only when x == 5 (notice the use of double equals)
x[x < 3] # less than 3
x[x < 3] = 0 # assign specific elements
casualty_age[casualty_age %% 6 == 0] # just the ages that are a multiple of 6
crashes[crashes$dark == FALSE, ]
```

1. Subset the `casualty_age` object using the inequality (`<`) so that only elements less than 50 are returned.
1. Subset the `crashes` data frame so that only tanks are returned using the `==` operator.
1. **Bonus**: assign the age of all tanks to 61.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
casualty_age[casualty_age < 50] # the  casualty_age less than 50
crashes[crashes$vehicle_type == "tank", ] # rows where the name is tank
crashes$casualty_age[crashes$vehicle_type == "tank"] = 61
```

## Dealing with NAs and recoding

R objects can have a value of NA. This is how R represents missing data.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
z = c(4, 5, NA, 7)
```

NA values are common in real-world data but can cause trouble, for example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sum(z) # result is NA
```

Some functions can be told to ignore NA values.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sum(z, na.rm = TRUE) # result is equal to 4 + 5 + 7
```

You can find NAs using the `is.na()` function, and then remove them

```{r, eval=FALSE}
is.na(z)
z_nona = z[!is.na(z)] # note the use of the not operator !
sum(z)
```

If you remove records with NAs be warned: the average of a value excluding NAs may not be representative.

## Changing class

Sometimes you may want to change the class of an object.
This is called class coercion, and can be done with functions such as `as.logical()`, `as.numeric()` and `as.matrix()`.

1. Coerce the `vehicle_type` column of `crashes` to the class `character`.
1. Coerce the `crashes` object into a matrix. What happened to the values?
1. **Bonus:** What is the difference between the output of `summary()` on `character` and `factor` variables?

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
crashes$vehicle_type = as.character(crashes$vehicle_type)
as.matrix(crashes)
```

## Recoding values

Often it is useful to 'recode' values.
In the raw STATS19 files, for example, -1 means NA.
There are many ways to recode values in R, the simplest and most mature of which is the use of factors, as shown below:

```{r}
z = c(1, 2, -1, 1, 3)
l = c(NA, "a", "b", "c") # labels in ascending order
z_factor = factor(z, labels = l)
z_charcter = as.character(z_factor)
z_charcter
```

1. Recode `z` to Slight, Serious and Fatal for 1:3 respectively.
1. Bonus: read the help file at `?dplyr::case_when` and try to recode the values using this function.

## Now you are ready to use R

**Bonus: reproduce the following plot**

```{r smile, out.width="30%", fig.align="center"}
# eyes = c(2.3, 4, 3.7, 4)
# eyes = matrix(eyes, ncol = 2, byrow = T)
# mouth = c(2, 2, 2.5, 1.3, 3, 1, 3.5, 1.3, 4, 2)
# mouth = matrix(mouth, ncol = 2, byrow = T)
# # pdf("figures/smile.pdf")
# # png("figures/smile.png")
# plot(eyes, type = "p", main = "RRR!", cex = 2, xlim = c(1, 5), ylim = c(0, 5))
# lines(mouth, type = "l", col = "red")
# dev.off()
knitr::include_graphics("figures/smile.png")
```
